# AppleClone React Website

This repository contains my code for the AppleClone React Website, a project I created while practicing React. The website is divided into sections, each represented by a separate component.

## Components

- **SectionOne**: Renders the first main section of the website.
- **SectionTwo**: Displays the second main section with relevant content.
- **SectionThree**: Renders the third main section of the website.
- **SectionFour**: Displays the fourth main section with content.
- **SectionFive**: Renders the fifth main section of the website.
- **SectionSix**: Displays the final main section of the website.
- **Footer**: Shows the bottom footer section of the website.
