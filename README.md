# AppleClone React Website

This repository contains my code for the AppleClone React Website, a project I created while practicing React. The website is divided into sections, each represented by a separate component.

## Components

- [Header](src/components/Header/Header.js): Displays the top navigation bar of the website.
- [SectionOne](src/components/SectionOne/SectionOne.js): Renders the first main section of the website.
- [SectionTwo](src/components/SectionTwo/SectionTwo.js): Displays the second main section with relevant content.
- [SectionThree](src/components/SectionThree/SectionThree.js): Renders the third main section of the website.
- [SectionFour](src/components/SectionFour/SectionFour.js): Displays the fourth main section with content.
- [SectionFive](src/components/SectionFive/SectionFive.js): Renders the fifth main section of the website.
- [SectionSix](src/components/SectionSix/SectionSix.js): Displays the final main section of the website.
- [Footer](src/components/Footer/Footer.js): Shows the bottom footer section of the website.
